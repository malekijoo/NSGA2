# NSGA2 

This is an implementation of **NSGA2** algorithms  
with complex Objectives and Constraints (penalty approach).

The NSGA2 is an evolutionary algorithm used for Decision-making on Real-World problems.  


> [!NOTE]
> In `./main` check out the settings and Run the algorithm.
> For customizing, go to `individual.py` and define your variables.
> In `problme.py` define your objectives and constraints.
> In `data.py` import your data in the format of pandas Dataframes.

> [!TIP]
> You can define a _Repair Strategy_  instead of _Penalty_ for constraints in `utils.py`
